# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Sunday from 3-4 PM
   at ISR. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting
   with sahitht2, then kevinlc2, and then rjliu3. Notes will be stored on a
   Google document, time-stamped for each meeting.

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord.
   Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to
   emails within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the 'project lead'
   for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the
   group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design
   decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will
   be accepted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it
   is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to
   adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will
   be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one
   or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be
   randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this
   leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a
   case by case basis.

2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is
   expected to independently work no less than two and no more than five hours
   per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest
   of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication,
   with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in
   pairs. It is the team's responsibility, not the individual's responsibility,
   to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

   However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may
   be asked - politely - to explain their circumstances. Based on their
   explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on
   a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

3. **Conflict Resolution** Team members will discuss with each other and
   consider the pros and cons of each solution. If no compromise can be made, we
   shall use a random number generator to select a solution.
