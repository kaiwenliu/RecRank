The presentation is nearly perfect. The final discovery of PageRank's effectiveness for this dataset is great. Although it covers all major points, you need to elaborate on many points. However, the introduction of each algorithm and the development process need elaboration. Have you encountered any challenges while you implemented the algorithm? How did you tackle them?

## **Written Report**
### Grade
100%

### Comments
The written report covers all major points. The presentation is nice and clear. However, the discussion lacks depth. For example, you should discuss how each algorithm matches your expectation. For example, you mentioned in the presentation that the PageRank algorithm does not work very well. You should consider including the insights of it doesn't work well and how to improve for future work.

Great job! You have achieved all of your goals. From creating graphs to testing final outputs, your project reflects the thoughtful design and careful execution. The graph is well structured, and your chosen algorithm fits the task mostly. The implementation of the algorithm is also excellent. It achieves decent efficiency. However, the code organization needs improvement. The directory hierarchy is hard to navigate.
