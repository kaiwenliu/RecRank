Week 1 Progress: 
  - We set the goals of gathering data, setting up the project environment, and finding the appropriate libaries to use. We have accomplished all of these goals. 
  - Richard accomplished the task of setting up the project environment and Sahith and Kevin both worked together and accomplished the tasks of gathering the data and finding the libaries we need to use. 
  - We haven't encountered any problems that impeded us from reaching our goal so far
  - For next week, we plan to implement the PageRank algorithm and making the data work with it.
